## Lab #3
*May 10, 2023*

> Part 1: Research Commands

This lab report is going to focus on the `grep` command and how different command-line options can prove useful.
For all in-line command arguments, I used the [official grep documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html#Introduction),
which shows all possible command-line options, their uses, along with a short explanation/examples when necessary.

> `grep -c`

```
$ grep -c "takeoff" chapter-1.txt
3
```
```
$ grep -c "aircraft" chapter-1.txt chapter-2.txt
chapter-1.txt:121
chapter-2.txt:1
```

The `-c` command will return the number of lines that contain the desired word, rather than just printing out 
the lines themselves. This is extremely useful for word count purposes rather than having to read through all the
lines given by the output. Furthermore when given multiple files, the output will specify which files contain the 
desired phrase, rather than grouping all the file counts together.

> `grep -L`

```
$ grep -L "RNA" 1468-6708-3-1.txt 1471-213X-1-1.txt rr37.txt        
1468-6708-3-1.txt
rr37.txt
```

```
$ grep -L "infection" ar799.txt bcr45.txt cc3.txt
cc3.txt
```

The `-L` command will print all files that do not have a match for the given input. In this case, "RNA" and "infection"
were not found in 2/3 and 1/3 of their respective files. This would be extremely useful if you needed to search for
files while avoiding a certain phrase or topic.

. `-m <number>`

```
$ grep -m 5 "treatment" DraftRecom-PDF.txt Session2-PDF.txt
DraftRecom-PDF.txt:treatment strategy, "Screening, Brief Intervention, and
DraftRecom-PDF.txt:mean sending a patient to a specialized treatment facility.
DraftRecom-PDF.txt:Larry Gentilello asserted that effective treatments already

```

```
$ grep -m 1 "drinking" Session4-PDF.txt
to moderate their drinking when compared with those who did not
```

The `-m <number>` command will only show a certain number of matches depending on the 
integer value given after the `-m` command. When given multiple files, the output will 
show the number of matches per file, as opposed to the number of matches over all files combined. 
For example, the first example shown resulted in 5 matches for "treatment" in DraftRecom-PDF.txt 
and 3 in Session2-PDF.txt, rather than just 5 matches overall. This proves useful to limit the output to
something legible. For instance, if you were searching a series of .txt files which all related to biology
and you wanted to search for "DNA", it would be extremely helpful to limit the output to around 10-15 times,
or else the terminal will be overrun with lines containing "DNA".

> `grep -y`

        JSTOR is successful for reasons its founders did not intend. Bill Bowen's inspired
        vision was of a solution to libraries' ever-voracious demands for space to house paper
        volumes. The idea was that libraries could save space by removing volumes available in
        important journal runs JSTOR has digitised. Paper holdings have not decreased dramatically,
        but electronic holdings have increased. So a space-saving service became an access

        readers. As the number of journal articles accessible over the networks increases, JSTOR
        will be seen as a small-scale pioneer from which we learned valuable lessons.
        funding to launch any such initiative has to be accompanied by a sound business plan to

Apologies for the long outputs, but that's all thanks to the `-y` command! `-y` will allow grep to bypass
case distinctions, allowing for more output. This is extremely useful for finding words/phrases in a file,
despite if they are the first word in the sentence, or if the word is refering to a proper noun, and other
similar cases. Now upper/lower cases will both be shown by grep when using the `-y` command.
